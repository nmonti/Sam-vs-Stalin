#Sam vs Stalin

Coded in VB6. Good luck being able to edit it even if you wanted to.

Control the image of Uncle Sam with the arrows, shoot with space.

I made this in high school, so in order to run the .exe all the media needs to be in the same folder as it. Downloading and running as-is from the folder should work.
